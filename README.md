### Backend [![README](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-339933?style=flat-square)](./apps/backend/README.md)

- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **WebSockets**: Custom WebSocket implementation with heartbeat
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Storage**: In-memory with persistence capability
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with 2FA

#### Backend Architecture Overview

The system is built with high modularity and loose coupling in mind:

```
src/
├── controllers/      # Entry points (WebSocket, HTTP)
├── methods/         # Business operations
├── subscriptions/   # Real-time update handlers
├── models/         # Data and business rules
├── core/           # Infrastructure services
└── shared/         # Common utilities
```

#### Layer Dependencies

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Controllers   │ → Entry points only
├─────────────────┤
│    Methods      │ → Business logic
│  Subscriptions  │ → Real-time updates
├─────────────────┤
│     Models      │ → Data & rules
├─────────────────┤
│      Core       │ → Infrastructure
├─────────────────┤
│     Shared      │ → Utilities
└─────────────────┘
```

#### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Unidirectional Dependencies**
   - Each layer depends only on layers below it
   - No circular dependencies allowed
   - Clear and predictable data flow

2. **Loose Coupling**
   - Layers communicate through well-defined interfaces
   - Implementation details are hidden
   - Easy to replace or modify components

3. **High Cohesion**
   - Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Scalability**
   - Independent scaling of components
   - Easy to add new features
   - Simple to extend existing functionality


#### WebSocket Communication

The backend implements a single WebSocket connection per client with several reliability features:

- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Ping-pong protocol to detect connection health
  - Server sends ping every 30 seconds
  - Client must respond with pong within 5 seconds
  - Connection is considered dead if no pong received

- **Message Protocol**:
  ```typescript
  // Request (Client -> Server)
  {
    type: string;      // Method name
    data: any;         // Method parameters
    eid: string;       // External ID for tracking
    ts: number;        // Timestamp
  }

  // Response (Server -> Client)
  {
    type: string;      // Original method name
    data: any;         // Response data
    eid: string;       // Same external ID
    ts: number;        // Timestamp
    error?: string;    // Optional error code
  }
  ```

#### PubSub System

The backend uses a robust PubSub pattern for real-time updates:

- **Decoupled Communication**: Publishers and subscribers are completely isolated
- **Topic-based Messaging**: Updates are organized by topics (e.g., 'seat.subscribe', 'cinemas.subscribe')
- **Selective Broadcasting**: Messages are delivered only to relevant subscribers
- **Subscription Management**:
  - Automatic cleanup on client disconnect
  - Support for temporary and permanent subscriptions
  - Rate limiting and backpressure handling

#### Layer Responsibilities

#### 1. Controllers

- Request handling
- Coordination between methods and subscriptions
- Dependencies: methods, subscriptions

#### 2. Methods & Subscriptions

- Methods: Business logic operations
- Subscriptions: Real-time update handling
- Dependencies: models
- Note: Methods and Subscriptions interact only through controllers

### 3. Models

- Data access
- Business rules implementation
- Dependencies: core

### 4. Core

- Infrastructure services (Database, WebSocket, PubSub)
- Dependencies: shared

### 5. Shared

- Types
- Constants
- Utility functions
- Dependencies: none

#### Data Flow Example

Example of `get_cinemas` request flow:

```typescript
// 1. Request arrives at entrypoint
WebSocket
  // 2. Routes to controller
  → CinemaController
    // 3. Controller calls method
    → getCinemas method
      // 4. Method works with model
      → CinemaModel
        // 5. Model uses core for data access
        → Database (core)
```

### Authentication Flows

#### Connection Authentication

0. FE open the socket connection.
1. While opening the connections, BE checks the http-only token in the cookie.
2. If token is active, user is logged in.
3. If token is expired or not exists, user is not logged in.

#### Login Flow

0. FE start to auth.
1. FE send request with username to BE.
2. BE checks username, and returns status:user and waiting for the 6-digit code.
3. FE enters 6 digits code from authenticator app and sends it to BE.
4. BE checks code and if it is correct, user is authorized.
5. BE returns a token to FE.
6. FE should recreate the socket connection.

#### Registration Flow

0. FE start to auth.
1. FE send request with username to BE.
2. BE checks username, and returns status:candidate with qr_code and waiting for the 6-digit code.
3. FE scans the qr_code and enters 6 digits code from authenticator app, then sends the code to BE.
4. BE checks code and if it is correct, user is authorized.
5. BE returns a token to FE.
6. FE should recreate the socket connection.
